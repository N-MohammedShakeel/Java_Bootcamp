# Dynamic Programming in Depth: A Guide for DSA Preparation

## 1. What is Dynamic Programming?
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a problem-solving technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations. It is particularly effective for optimization problems and problems with a recursive structure.

- **Key Idea**: Solve complex problems by combining solutions to simpler subproblems, using memoization or tabulation to store intermediate results.
- **Applications**: Optimization problems (e.g., shortest path, maximum profit), counting problems, sequence problems, and more.
- **Core Properties**:
  - **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
  - **Overlapping Subproblems**: The same subproblems are solved multiple times in a recursive solution, making it inefficient without DP.

## 2. How Dynamic Programming Works
DP solves problems in two main ways:
### 2.1 Top-Down (Memoization)
- **Description**: Start with the original problem and recursively break it into subproblems. Store solutions to subproblems in a memoization table (e.g., array, HashMap) to avoid recomputation.
- **Process**:
  1. Define a recursive function for the problem.
  2. Check if the subproblem’s solution is already in the memo table.
  3. If not, compute the solution and store it; if yes, return the stored result.
- **Pros**: Intuitive, follows the natural recursive structure, only computes needed subproblems.
- **Cons**: Recursive call stack can cause stack overflow for large inputs, slightly slower due to function calls.
- **Example**: Fibonacci sequence with memoization.

### 2.2 Bottom-Up (Tabulation)
- **Description**: Solve subproblems iteratively, starting from the smallest subproblems and building up to the original problem. Store results in a table (e.g., array, matrix).
- **Process**:
  1. Identify the smallest subproblems and their solutions.
  2. Use a loop to fill the DP table, using previously computed values.
  3. The final answer is in the table’s last cell or derived from it.
- **Pros**: Avoids recursion, more space-efficient (no call stack), often faster.
- **Cons**: Requires careful ordering of subproblem solutions, may compute unneeded subproblems.
- **Example**: Knapsack problem with a 2D table.

## 3. Steps to Solve a DP Problem
1. **Identify if DP Applies**:
   - Check for optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
   - Look for problems involving optimization (max/min), counting, or sequences.
2. **Define the State**:
   - Determine variables that describe a subproblem (e.g., index, remaining capacity).
   - State is often represented as `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]` in the DP table.
3. **Formulate the Transition**:
   - Write a recurrence relation that expresses the solution to a state in terms of smaller states.
   - Example: `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])` for House Robber.
4. **Initialize Base Cases**:
   - Set initial values for the smallest subproblems (e.g., `dp[0] = 0`).
   - Handle edge cases carefully to avoid errors.
5. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Use memoization (top-down) or tabulation (bottom-up).
   - Optimize space if possible (e.g., use rolling arrays).
6. **Extract the Answer**:
   - The final answer is typically in `dp[n]` or derived from the table.

## 4. Types of DP Problems
### 4.1 1D DP
- Involves a single state variable, often an index.
- Examples: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs (LeetCode #70), House Robber (LeetCode #198).
- DP Table: `dp[i]` where `i` is the state (e.g., index).

### 4.2 2D DP
- Involves two state variables (e.g., index and capacity).
- Examples: Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence (LeetCode #1143), Edit Distance (LeetCode #72).
- DP Table: `dp[i][j]` where `i`, `j` are states.

### 4.3 State Transition DP
- Involves states with specific transitions (e.g., buy/sell in stock problems).
- Examples: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (LeetCode #121), Unique Paths (LeetCode #62).
- DP Table: May use multiple states or auxiliary variables.

### 4.4 Bitmask DP
- Uses a bitmask to represent a set of states (e.g., visited nodes).
- Examples: Traveling Salesman Problem, Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets (LeetCode #698).
- DP Table: `dp[mask][i]` where `mask` tracks state inclusion.

### 4.5 Digit DP
- Processes digits of a number to count or optimize.
- Examples: Count numbers with specific properties in a range.
- DP Table: `dp[pos][sum][tight]` where `pos` is digit position, `tight` tracks constraints.

## 5. Common DP Patterns
- **Knapsack Variants**: 0/1 Knapsack, Fractional Knapsack, Subset Sum.
- **Sequence Problems**: Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS), Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).
- **Path Problems**: Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum (LeetCode #64).
- **Partition Problems**: Partition Equal Subset Sum (LeetCode #416).
- **Game Theory**: Stone Game, Optimal Game Strategy.
- **Matrix DP**: Matrix Chain Multiplication, Maximum Square (LeetCode #221).

## 6. DP Implementation in Java
### 6.1 Memoization Template
```java
Map<String, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
int dp(int state1, int state2) {
    String key = state1 + "," + state2;
    if (memo.containsKey(key)) return memo.get(key);
    // Base cases
    if (state1 == base_condition) return base_value;
    // Recurrence relation
    int result = compute(state1, state2);
    memo.put(key, result);
    return result;
}
```

### 6.2 Tabulation Template
```java
int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1];
// Initialize base cases
dp[0][0] = base_value;
// Fill table
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
        dp[i][j] = compute(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], ...);
    }
}
// Answer
return dp[n][m];
```

## 7. Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Depends on the number of states and transitions.
  - 1D DP: O(n) states, O(1) per state → O(n).
  - 2D DP: O(n * m) states, O(1) per state → O(n * m).
  - Bitmask DP: O(2^n * n) states for n elements.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - Memoization: O(number of unique states) + O(recursion stack).
  - Tabulation: O(size of DP table), can be optimized with rolling arrays.
  - Example: Knapsack uses O(n * W) space, reducible to O(W) with 1D array.

## 8. Common Pitfalls
- **Incorrect State Definition**: Ensure state captures all necessary information.
- **Missing Base Cases**: Handle edge cases (e.g., n = 0, empty input).
- **Overflow**: Use `long` or modulo for large numbers.
- **Space Inefficiency**: Optimize with rolling arrays or in-place updates.
- **Cycle in Recursion**: Ensure memoization prevents redundant calls.
- **Index Out of Bounds**: Validate indices in DP table.

## 9. Java-Specific Tips
- Use `int[]`, `int[][]`, or `HashMap` for DP tables based on problem size.
- Initialize arrays with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` or `-1` for min/max problems.
- Use `String` keys for memoization with multiple states (e.g., `i + "," + j`).
- Handle modulo operations (`10^9 + 7`) for counting problems.
- Debug with print statements to trace DP table values.

## 11. Optimization Techniques
- **Space Optimization**: Use rolling arrays or 1D arrays for 2D problems (e.g., Knapsack).
- **State Compression**: Reduce state variables if possible (e.g., use modulo for cyclic states).
- **Precompute Transitions**: For complex transitions, precompute values to reduce per-state work.
- **Early Termination**: Stop computation if the answer is found early (e.g., in optimization problems).
- **Bit Manipulation**: Use bitmasks for state representation in combinatorial problems.

## 12. Limitations
- **Large State Space**: DP is impractical for very large state spaces (e.g., n > 10^5 without optimization).
- **Non-Optimal Substructure**: DP doesn’t apply if subproblems don’t combine optimally.
- **Complex Transitions**: Some problems require advanced techniques (e.g., convex hull for LIS).
