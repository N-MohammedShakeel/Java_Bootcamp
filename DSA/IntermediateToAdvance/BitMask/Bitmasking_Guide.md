# Bitmasking in Depth: A Guide for DSA Preparation

## 1. What is Bitmasking?
Bitmasking is a technique that uses the bits of an integer to represent a set, state, or configuration. Each bit in the integer corresponds to an element or condition (e.g., included/excluded in a set, visited/unvisited in a graph). By leveraging bitwise operations, bitmasking enables compact storage and efficient manipulation of states, often reducing space and time complexity.

- **Key Idea**: Use a single integer (or long) to represent a set of up to 32 (or 64) elements, where each bit indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of an element.
- **Applications**: Subset generation, dynamic programming (DP) on subsets, solving combinatorial problems, and optimizing state-based algorithms like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
- **Advantages**:
  - Compact representation: A 32-bit integer can represent 2^32 states.
  - Fast operations: Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) are extremely efficient.
  - Simplifies state tracking in recursive or DP algorithms.

## 2. Bitwise Operations in Bitmasking
Bitmasking relies on bitwise operations in Java:
- **AND (&)**: Checks if bits are set in both operands. Used to test if an element is in a set.
  - Example: `mask & (1 << i)` checks if the i-th bit is set (i.e., element i is included).
- **OR (|)**: Sets bits if present in either operand. Used to add an element to a set.
  - Example: `mask | (1 << i)` sets the i-th bit (adds element i).
- **XOR (^)**: Toggles bits. Used to flip the state of an element.
  - Example: `mask ^ (1 << i)` toggles the i-th bit (include/exclude element i).
- **NOT (~)**: Inverts all bits. Rarely used directly in bitmasking.
- **Left Shift (<<)**: Shifts bits left, used to create a mask for a specific position.
  - Example: `1 << i` creates a mask with only the i-th bit set (2^i).
- **Right Shift (>>)**: Shifts bits right, used to access specific bits.
- **Bit Clear**: `mask & ~(1 << i)` clears the i-th bit (removes element i).

## 3. When to Use Bitmasking
Use bitmasking when:
- You need to represent a set or subset of elements (e.g., items included in a knapsack).
- The problem involves state tracking (e.g., visited cities in TSP).
- The number of elements is small (≤32 for int, ≤64 for long) due to bit limitations.
- You want to optimize space or time in DP or backtracking problems.

Common problems include:
- Generating all subsets.
- Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
- Assigning tasks or resources (e.g., bipartite matching).
- Subset sum with constraints.

## 4. Bitmasking Template
A typical bitmasking approach (often combined with backtracking or DP) looks like this in Java:

```java
void solveWithBitmask(int n, Parameters) {
    // Iterate through all possible subsets (2^n combinations)
    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        // Process the subset represented by mask
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                // Element i is included in the subset
                processElement(i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For DP with bitmasking:
```java
int dp(int mask, OtherParameters, int[][] memo) {
    // Base case: If all elements are processed
    if (mask == (1 << n) - 1) {
        return baseCaseValue;
    }
    // Check memoized result
    if (memo[mask][otherParameters] != -1) {
        return memo[mask][otherParameters];
    }
    // Try each possible next element
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if ((mask & (1 << i)) == 0) { // If element i is not used
            // Include element i
            int newMask = mask | (1 << i);
            // Recurse and update result
            result = combine(result, dp(newMask, updatedParameters, memo));
        }
    }
    return memo[mask][otherParameters] = result;
}
```

## 5. Applications of Bitmasking
- **Subset Generation**: Represent subsets as bitmasks to generate all possible combinations.
- **Dynamic Programming on Subsets**: Use bitmasks to track which elements are included in a solution (e.g., TSP, knapsack).
- **Graph Problems**: Track visited nodes or edges (e.g., Hamiltonian cycle).
- **Optimization Problems**: Solve assignment or matching problems efficiently.

## 6. Example Problems
Below are two example problems with Java implementations (provided separately):
1. **Easy**: Generate All Subsets using Bitmasking.
2. **Medium**: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Bitmasking and DP.

## 7. Optimization Techniques
- **Precompute Masks**: Calculate common masks (e.g., `(1 << n) - 1` for all elements included).
- **Use Long for Larger Sets**: For n > 32, use `long` or multiple integers.
- **Combine with DP**: Memoize results to avoid recomputing for the same mask.
- **Prune Invalid States**: Skip masks that violate problem constraints.
- **Bit Hacks**: Use tricks like `mask & (mask - 1)` to clear the least significant set bit or `Integer.bitCount(mask)` to count set bits.

## 8. Common Pitfalls
- **Overflow**: Ensure n ≤ 32 (int) or n ≤ 64 (long) to avoid bit overflow.
- **Off-by-One Errors**: Be careful with bit positions (0-based indexing).
- **State Management**: Ensure masks are updated correctly in recursive calls.
- **Memory Usage**: DP with bitmasking can consume significant memory (e.g., O(2^n * m) for TSP).

## 10. Java-Specific Tips
- Use `Integer.bitCount(mask)` to count set bits (e.g., number of elements in a subset).
- Use `1 << i` for creating masks and `mask & (1 << i)` for checking bits.
- Be cautious with array bounds when mapping bits to elements.
- Use `long` for problems with n > 32.

## 11. Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Typically O(2^n) for iterating through all subsets, or O(2^n * m) for DP with bitmasking, where m is an additional parameter (e.g., number of cities in TSP).
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^n * m) for DP memoization, O(n) for recursive stack in backtracking.
