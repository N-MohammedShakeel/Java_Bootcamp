## Part 1: Workflow and Algorithms of Trees

Trees are like upside-down family trees in computer science, where one "parent" (top node) connects to "children" (nodes below), and those children can have their own children. They’re used to organize data hierarchically, like folders in a computer or a company’s staff chart. Each type of tree has a unique way of organizing and managing data, and we’ll explore eight common types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, Trie, N-ary Tree, Segment Tree, and Fenwick Tree.

### 1. Binary Tree
**What is it?**
A Binary Tree is the simplest tree where each node can have up to two children (left and right). Think of it like a family tree where each person can have at most two kids. It’s not necessarily organized by value, just by connections.

**How does it work?**
- **Structure**: Starts with a root node (the "grandparent"). Each node has a value and pointers to a left child and a right child (or none if they’re empty).
- **Use Case**: Representing hierarchies, like a company’s reporting structure or a decision tree in a game.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insert**: Add a new node. One way is to find the first empty spot by checking nodes level by level (like filling seats in rows at an event).
  - **Search**: Look for a value by checking every node, exploring left and right children until found or exhausted.
  - **Delete**: Remove a node by replacing it with the deepest leaf (like swapping a worker with someone at the lowest level) and removing the leaf.

**Algorithms**:
- **Insert (Level-Order)**:
  - *Purpose*: Add a new node in a balanced way.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Create a new node with the given value.
    2. If the tree is empty, make this the root.
    3. Else, use a queue to visit nodes level by level.
    4. Find the first node with an empty left or right child.
    5. Attach the new node there.
  - *Example*: To add 5 to a tree with {1,2,3}, if 1 is root, 2 is left, 3 is right, add 5 as 2’s left child.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(n) – may check all n nodes to find an empty spot.
  - *Space Complexity*: O(w) – queue holds up to w nodes (tree’s width).
- **Search**:
  - *Purpose*: Find if a value exists.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Start at the root.
    2. If the node is null or matches the value, return true/false.
    3. Recursively check left and right children.
  - *Example*: Search 2 in {1,2,3} – check 1, then 2 (found).
  - *Time Complexity*: O(n) – may visit all nodes.
  - *Space Complexity*: O(h) – recursion stack, h is height.
- **Delete**:
  - *Purpose*: Remove a node.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Find the target node using a search.
    2. Find the deepest rightmost leaf using a queue.
    3. Replace the target’s value with the leaf’s value.
    4. Remove the leaf.
  - *Example*: Delete 2 from {1,2,3,4,5} – replace 2 with 5, remove 5.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(n).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(w).

**HackWithInfy**: Binary trees appear in Easy problems like finding height or counting nodes.

### 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
**What is it?**
A BST is a Binary Tree where nodes are organized by value: the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is larger. It’s like a library catalog sorted by book ID, making searches faster.

**How does it work?**
- **Structure**: Root node has a value; left subtree has smaller values, right has larger.
- **Use Case**: Fast searching, sorting (inorder traversal gives sorted order).
- **Operations**:
  - **Insert*: Place a value in the correct position based on comparisons.
  - **Search*: Compare values to navigate left or right.
  - **Delete*: Remove a node, handling cases like leaf, one child, or two children.

**Algorithms**:
- **Insert**:
  - *Purpose*: Add a value in sorted order.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Start at the root.
    2. If the tree is empty, create a new node as root.
    3. Compare the value with the current node:
       - If smaller, go left.
       - If larger, go right.
    4. Recursively repeat until an empty spot is found.
    5. Place the new node there.
  - *Example*: Insert 40 into {50,30,70} – compare with 50 (go left), 30 (go right), place at 30’s right.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(h) – h is height (O(log n) if balanced, O(n) if skewed).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(h) – recursion stack.
- **Search**:
  - *Purpose*: Find a value.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Start at the root.
    2. If the node is null, return false.
    3. If the node matches the value, return true.
    4. If the value is smaller, go left; if larger, go right.
  - *Example*: Search 30 in {50,30,70} – compare with 50 (go left), found 30.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(h).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(h).
- **Delete**:
  - *Purpose*: Remove a node while maintaining BST property.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Find the node to delete.
    2. If it’s a leaf, remove it.
    3. If it has one child, replace it with the child.
    4. If it has two children, find the smallest node in the right subtree (successor), replace the node’s value with the successor’s, and delete the successor.
  - *Example*: Delete 30 from {50,30,70,20,40} – replace 30 with 40, remove 40.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(h).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(h).

**HackWithInfy**: BSTs are common in Medium problems like validating a BST or finding the lowest common ancestor.

### 3. AVL Tree
**What is it?**
An AVL Tree is a BST that automatically balances itself to keep searches fast. It’s like a self-organizing library shelf that adjusts books to avoid long searches.

**How does it work?**
- **Structure**: Like a BST, but each node tracks its height. The height difference (balance factor) between left and right subtrees is at most 1.
- **Use Case**: Applications needing guaranteed fast searches, like databases.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insert**: Add a node like BST, then adjust the tree with rotations if unbalanced.
  - **Rotations**: Reorganize nodes to restore balance (e.g., left or right rotations).

**Algorithms**:
- **Insert**:
  - *Purpose*: Add a value and keep the tree balanced.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Insert like a BST.
    2. Update heights of ancestor nodes.
    3. Check the balance factor (left height – right height).
    4. If unbalanced (|balance| > 1), perform rotations:
       - Left-Left (LL): Right rotate the unbalanced node.
       - Right-Right (RR): Left rotate.
       - Left-Right (LR): Left rotate the left child, then right rotate the node.
       - Right-Left (RL): Right rotate the right child, then left rotate the node.
  - *Example*: Insert 10,20,30 (unbalanced), rotate to balance.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(log n) – balanced height.
  - *Space Complexity*: O(log n) – recursion stack.
- **Rotations**:
  - *Purpose*: Restore balance.
  - *Steps (Right Rotation)*:
    1. Take the unbalanced node (y) and its left child (x).
    2. Make x the new root, y its right child.
    3. Move x’s right child to y’s left.
    4. Update heights.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(1) per rotation.
  - *Space Complexity*: O(1).

**HackWithInfy**: AVL Trees appear in Medium/Hard problems involving balanced trees.

### 4. Red-Black Tree
**What is it?**
A Red-Black Tree is another self-balancing BST, using colors (red/black) to ensure balance. It’s like a BST with a rulebook to keep it organized.

**How does it work?**
- **Structure**: Nodes are red or black, with rules:
  - Root is black.
  - No two red nodes can be adjacent.
  - Every path from root to leaf has the same number of black nodes.
- **Use Case**: Used in Java’s TreeMap, file systems.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insert**: Add a red node, then fix violations with rotations and recoloring.

**Algorithms**:
- **Insert**:
  - *Purpose*: Add a value and maintain red-black properties.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Insert like a BST, coloring the new node red.
    2. If the parent is red (violating no-adjacent-red rule), fix:
       - If the uncle (parent’s sibling) is red, recolor parent and uncle black, grandparent red, and check grandparent.
       - If the uncle is black, perform rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL) and recolor.
    3. Ensure the root is black.
  - *Example*: Insert 10,20,30 – adjust colors/rotations to balance.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(log n).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(log n).
- **Rotations**:
  - Similar to AVL, with color adjustments.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(1).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(1).

**HackWithInfy**: Hard problems, often in advanced balancing scenarios.

### 5. Trie
**What is it?**
A Trie (prefix tree) stores strings, with each node representing a character. It’s like a dictionary where words share common prefixes.

**How does it work?**
- **Structure**: Root is empty; each node has up to 26 children (for letters a-z). A flag marks the end of a word.
- **Use Case**: Autocomplete, spell checkers.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insert**: Add a word by creating nodes for each letter.
  - **Search**: Check if a word exists.
  - **Prefix Search**: Check if any word starts with a prefix.

**Algorithms**:
- **Insert**:
  - *Purpose*: Add a word.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Start at the root.
    2. For each letter, go to (or create) the corresponding child node.
    3. Mark the final node as the end of a word.
  - *Example*: Insert “cat” – create nodes c-a-t, mark t as end.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(m) – m is word length.
  - *Space Complexity*: O(m) – nodes for unique prefix.
- **Search**:
  - *Purpose*: Find a word.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Start at the root.
    2. For each letter, follow the child node.
    3. If a node is missing, return false.
    4. At the end, check if the node is marked as a word end.
  - *Example*: Search “cat” – follow c-a-t, check end flag.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(m).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(1).
- **Prefix Search**:
  - *Purpose*: Check for prefix.
  - *Steps*: Like search, but stop at the prefix’s last letter.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(m).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(1).

**HackWithInfy**: Medium problems like autocomplete or prefix matching.

### 6. N-ary Tree
**What is it?**
An N-ary Tree allows each node to have any number of children. It’s like a family tree where a parent can have many kids.

**How does it work?**
- **Structure**: Each node has a value and a list of children.
- **Use Case**: File systems, organizational charts.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insert**: Add a child to a specific parent.
  - **Search**: Find a value by checking all children.

**Algorithms**:
- **Insert**:
  - *Purpose*: Add a child node.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Find the parent node by searching.
    2. Add a new node to the parent’s children list.
  - *Example*: Add 5 as a child of 2 in {1,2,3} – find 2, add 5 to its children.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(n) – search may visit all nodes.
  - *Space Complexity*: O(h) – recursion stack.
- **Search**:
  - *Purpose*: Find a value.

### 7. Segment Tree
**What is it?**
A Segment Tree is a binary tree for answering range queries (e.g., sum of numbers in a range) efficiently. It’s like a calculator that precomputes sums for quick lookups.

**How does it work?**
- **Structure**: Built from an array, where each node stores the sum (or other aggregate) of a range. Leaf nodes store individual array elements.
- **Use Case**: Range sum/min/max queries in large datasets.
- **Operations**:
  - **Build**: Create the tree from an array.
  - **Query**: Get the sum of a range.
  - **Update**: Change a value and update the tree.

**Algorithms**:
- **Build**:
  - *Purpose*: Construct the tree.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Divide the array into two halves.
    2. Recursively build left and right subtrees.
    3. Store the sum of children in the current node.
  - *Example*: For [1,3,5,7], leaf nodes store 1,3,5,7; parents store sums like 4 (1+3).
  - *Time Complexity*: O(n).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(n) – tree size.
- **Query**:
  - *Purpose*: Get sum in range [left, right].
  - *Steps*:
    1. If the node’s range is fully within [left, right], return its value.
    2. If outside, return 0.
    3. Else, recursively query left and right children and sum results.
  - *Example*: Query sum [1,3] – combine nodes covering 3,5,7.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(log n).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(log n).
- **Update**:
  - *Purpose*: Change a value.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Find the leaf node for the index.
    2. Update its value.
    3. Recursively update parent sums.
  - *Example*: Update index 2 to 10 – change leaf, update ancestors.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(log n).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(log n).

**HackWithInfy**: Hard problems like dynamic range queries.

### 8. Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
**What is it?**
A Fenwick Tree is a compact structure for cumulative sums, like a running total calculator. It’s simpler than a Segment Tree but serves similar purposes.

**How does it work?**
- **Structure**: An array where each index stores the sum of a range, using bitwise operations to navigate.
- **Use Case**: Cumulative frequency tables, range sum queries.
- **Operations**:
  - **Update**: Add a value at an index.
  - **Query**: Get the sum up to an index.

    2. Add the value to the current position.
    3. Move to the next affected index using bitwise operations (index += index & -index).
    4. Repeat until out of bounds.
  - *Example*: Update index 2 by 5 – update positions 2,4,8.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(log n).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(1).
- **Query**:
  - *Purpose*: Get prefix sum.
  - *Steps*:
    1. Start at the index.

    4. Repeat until index is 0.
  - *Example*: Query sum up to 3 – sum positions 3,2.
  - *Time Complexity*: O(log n).
  - *Space Complexity*: O(1).

**HackWithInfy**: Hard problems like counting smaller elements.

## Part 2: Explanation of Tree Traversals

Traversals are ways to visit every node in a tree, like exploring rooms in a house. For binary trees, we have two main approaches: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). BFS explores level by level, while DFS dives deep into branches. We’ll cover BFS (Level-Order), DFS variants (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder), and Morris traversals (space-saving DFS).

### 1. BFS (Level-Order Traversal)
**What is it?**
BFS visits nodes level by level, like checking all rooms on the first floor of a house before going upstairs. It’s called Level-Order in trees because it processes nodes by their distance from the root.

**How does it work?**
- **Analogy**: Imagine a queue at a ticket counter. You serve people in the order they arrive (first floor first, then second).
- **Steps**:
  1. Start with the root in a queue.
  2. While the queue isn’t empty:
     - Remove the front node and visit it (print its value).
     - Add its left child to the queue (if exists).
     - Add its right child to the queue (if exists).
- **Example**: For tree {1,2,3,4,5}:
  - Queue: [1] → Visit 1, add 2,3 → Queue: [2,3]
  - Visit 2, add 4,5 → Queue: [3,4,5]
  - Visit 3,4,5 → Output: 1 2 3 4 5
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) – visits each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(w) – queue holds up to w nodes (tree’s width).
- **Use Case**: Finding the shortest path, level-based problems (e.g., LeetCode #102).

**HackWithInfy**: Common in Easy/Medium problems like level averages or max depth.

---

### 2. DFS: Inorder Traversal (Left, Root, Right)
**What is it?**
Inorder traversal is a DFS method that visits the left subtree, the root, then the right subtree. For a BST, it gives values in sorted order, like reading a bookshelf from left to right.

**How does it work?**
- **Analogy**: Explore the left wing of a house completely, visit the main hall, then explore the right wing.
- **Steps**:
  1. If the node is null, return.
  2. Recursively visit the left subtree.
  3. Visit the current node (print its value).
  4. Recursively visit the right subtree.
- **Example**: For tree {1,2,3,4,5}:
  - Start at 1 → Go left to 2 → Go left to 4 → Visit 4
  - Back to 2 → Visit 2 → Go right to 5 → Visit 5
  - Back to 1 → Visit 1 → Go right to 3 → Visit 3
  - Output: 4 2 5 1 3
- **Time Complexity**: O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) – recursion stack.
- **Use Case**: Sorted output for BSTs (e.g., LeetCode #94).

**HackWithInfy**: Essential for Medium problems like BST validation.

---

### 3. DFS: Preorder Traversal (Root, Left, Right)
**What is it?**
Preorder traversal visits the root first, then the left subtree, then the right. It’s like a boss giving orders before their team starts work.

**How does it work?**
- **Analogy**: Check the main hall, then explore the left wing, then the right wing.
- **Steps**:
  1. If the node is null, return.
  2. Visit the current node.
  3. Recursively visit the left subtree.
  4. Recursively visit the right subtree.
- **Example**: For tree {1,2,3,4,5}:
  - Visit 1 → Go left to 2 → Visit 2 → Go left to 4 → Visit 4
  - Go right to 5 → Visit 5 → Back to 1 → Go right to 3 → Visit 3
  - Output: 1 2 4 5 3
- **Time Complexity**: O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(h).
- **Use Case**: Copying a tree, prefix expressions (e.g., LeetCode #144).

**HackWithInfy**: Common in Medium problems like tree reconstruction.

---

### 4. DFS: Postorder Traversal (Left, Right, Root)
**What is it?**
Postorder traversal visits the left subtree, then the right, then the root. It’s like cleaning up the kids’ rooms before the main house.

**How does it work?**
- **Analogy**: Explore the left wing, then the right wing, then check the main hall.
- **Steps**:
  1. If the node is null, return.
  2. Recursively visit the left subtree.
  3. Recursively visit the right subtree.
  4. Visit the current node.
- **Example**: For tree {1,2,3,4,5}:
  - Start at 1 → Go left to 2 → Go left to 4 → Visit 4
  - Go right to 5 → Visit 5 → Visit 2
  - Back to 1 → Go right to 3 → Visit 3 → Visit 1
  - Output: 4 5 2 3 1
- **Time Complexity**: O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(h).
- **Use Case**: Deleting a tree, postfix expressions (e.g., LeetCode #145).

**HackWithInfy**: Used in Medium problems like expression evaluation.

---

### 5. Morris Inorder Traversal (DFS, Space-Optimized)
**What is it?**
Morris Inorder is a DFS traversal that avoids using a stack or recursion, saving space. It’s like leaving breadcrumbs to find your way back without a map.

**How does it work?**
- **Analogy**: Explore the left wing, but tie a string to the rightmost room to jump back to the main hall.
- **Steps**:
  1. Start at the current node.
  2. If no left child, visit the node and go right.
  3. If there’s a left child:
     - Find the rightmost node in the left subtree (predecessor).
     - If the predecessor’s right is null, link it to the current node and go left.
     - If linked, unlink and visit the current node, then go right.
- **Example**: For tree {1,2,3,4,5} – threads nodes to produce 4 2 5 1 3.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) – each edge is traversed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) – no extra space.
- **Use Case**: Space-constrained problems (e.g., LeetCode #99).

**HackWithInfy**: Hard problems requiring optimization.

---

### 6. Morris Preorder Traversal (DFS, Space-Optimized)
**What is it?**
Morris Preorder is like Morris Inorder but visits the node before going left, similar to Preorder DFS.

**How does it work?**
- **Analogy**: Check the main hall, leave a breadcrumb, then explore the left wing.
- **Steps**: Same as Morris Inorder, but visit the node when first threading.
- **Example**: For tree {1,2,3,4,5} – produces 1 2 4 5 3.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1).
- **Use Case**: Space-efficient preorder tasks.

**HackWithInfy**: Hard problems like tree flattening.
