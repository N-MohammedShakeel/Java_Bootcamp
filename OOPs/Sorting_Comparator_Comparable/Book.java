    /**
     * Internal Implementation Details:
     * - Comparable (compareTo): Invoked by Arrays.sort() to compare BookImpl objects pairwise. Returns -1, 0, or 1 based
     *   on price comparison using Double.compare(), handling floating-point precision (e.g., NaN). JVM uses TimSort,
     *   a hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort, with O(n log n) complexity.
     * - Comparator (compare): YearComparator and lambdas define custom ordering. Comparator objects are instantiated once
     *   per sort call and reused. Chained comparisons (e.g., price then year) are evaluated sequentially.
     * - Object Creation: Sorting reorders array references in-place, creating no new BookImpl objects. Comparator instances
     *   (e.g., new YearComparator()) are lightweight, allocated once. Lambda comparators are compiled to synthetic classes.
     * - JVM Behavior: TimSort minimizes comparisons by exploiting partially sorted data. NullPointerException is prevented
     *   by nullsLast in lambdas. compareTo() assumes non-null objects; null BookImpls would throw an exception.
     * - Memory: Sorting uses O(n) auxiliary space for merging in TimSort. No additional BookImpl objects are instantiated.
     *
     * Professional Practices:
     * - Use generics (Comparable<BookImpl>, Comparator<BookImpl>) for type safety, eliminating ClassCastException risks.
     * - Ensure immutability with final fields to prevent sorting inconsistencies.
     * - Handle nulls with Comparator.nullsLast to avoid NullPointerException.
     * - Use utility methods (Double.compare, Integer.compare) for precise, overflow-safe comparisons.
     * - Provide getters for method references in lambda-based sorting (e.g., BookImpl::getYear).
     * - Format toString clearly for debugging (e.g., Book{title='Java', ...}).
     * - Test edge cases like null titles and equal prices for robustness.
     *
     * Notes for Mastery:
     * - Comparable defines a single natural ordering (price), ideal for default sorting in collections like TreeSet.
     * - Comparator enables flexible sorting (year, title), supporting dynamic requirements.
     * - Multi-field sorting (price then year) resolves ties, ensuring deterministic results.
     * - Null handling is critical for production code to prevent runtime errors.
     * - Lambda comparators (Comparator.comparing) offer concise, modern syntax.
     * - Avoid subtraction (e.g., year - b.year) to prevent integer overflow; use compare methods.
     * - Understand TimSortâ€™s efficiency for real-world sorting performance.
