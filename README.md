## About the Repository
This repository is intended for students, beginners, and professionals who want to learn Java step by step and develop strong programming and problem-solving skills.  
The folders are organized in a logical learning order — starting from basic Java syntax to advanced DSA patterns and interview-focused problem sets.

---

## Topics Covered
- Java Fundamentals (syntax, variables, data types, control flow, operators, methods)
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation)
- Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, Queue)
- Exception Handling
- Advanced Java (generics, streams, lambdas, multithreading)
- SOLID Principles & Other Design Principles
- Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy techniques)
- LeetCode & competitive programming problems
- DSA problem-solving patterns

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or above
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
- Git (optional but recommended)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/N-MohammedShakeel/Java_Bootcamp.git
cd Java_Bootcamp

## How to Use This Repository

* Beginners should start with `JavaBasics` and `OOPs`
* Move to `Collections` and `Advanced_Java` for intermediate mastery
* Use the `SOLID_Principle` and `Other_DesignPrinciples` folders to understand clean architecture
* For interview preparation, move to `DSA`, `DSA_Patterns`, and `Leetcode`
* Modify and run programs for better understanding — hands-on learning is highly encouraged

---

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome. You may contribute by:

* Adding examples for existing topics
* Adding new topics/modules
* Improving code readability or structure
* Providing documentation or explanations

Before submitting pull requests:

1. Ensure code is formatted and commented properly
