# Cryptography Using Core Java: A Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Introduction
Cryptography is the science of securing communication and data through techniques like encryption, hashing, and digital signatures. In Java, the `java.security` and `javax.crypto` packages provide robust APIs for implementing cryptographic algorithms, enabling developers to build secure applications using Core Java without external libraries. This guide introduces cryptography concepts, their implementation in Java, and their relevance to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and security applications.

- **Purpose**: Equip developers with the knowledge to implement cryptographic techniques for securing data, ensuring integrity, and verifying authenticity using Core Java.
- **Key Features**:
  - Support for symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, digital signatures, and secure random number generation.
  - Thread-safe APIs suitable for multithreaded applications.
  - Portable across platforms due to Java’s “write once, run anywhere” principle.
- **Use Case**: Secure file storage, network communication, password management, and software verification.
- **DSA Relevance**: Cryptographic algorithms involve bitwise operations, key generation, and data manipulation, aligning with DSA concepts like arrays, bit manipulation, and modular arithmetic.

## 2. Modules Overview
This guide is divided into six modules, each focusing on a core cryptographic concept, followed by a capstone project module to apply these concepts practically.

### Module 1: Introduction to Cryptography
- **Topics**: Evolution, need, types (symmetric, asymmetric, hashing), key concepts (plaintext, ciphertext, keys, cipher modes), digital signatures, Java’s cryptographic APIs.
- **Purpose**: Provide foundational knowledge for understanding cryptographic techniques and their Java implementations.

### Module 2: Symmetric Key Encryption
- **Topics**: Concept of symmetric encryption, cipher modes (ECB, CBC), padding schemes (PKCS5Padding), AES, DES, Triple DES, string/file encryption.
- **Purpose**: Teach how to use symmetric algorithms for fast, secure data encryption.

### Module 3: Asymmetric Key Encryption
- **Topics**: Public/private key concepts, RSA key generation, RSA encryption/decryption, Java classes (`KeyPair`, `KeyPairGenerator`, `Cipher`).
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate secure data exchange using public-key cryptography.

### Module 4: Hashing and Message Digests
- **Topics**: Hashing concepts, one-way functions, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, file/string hashing, SecureRandom for salts.
- **Purpose**: Explain how to ensure data integrity and verify passwords using hashing.

### Module 5: Digital Signatures and Verification
- **Topics**: Digital signature concepts, signing/verifying with RSA, Java’s `Signature` class, use cases (software signing, messaging).
- **Purpose**: Show how to authenticate data and verify integrity using digital signatures.

### Module 6: Secure Random Number Generation
- **Topics**: Importance of randomness, `Random` vs. `SecureRandom`, generating tokens, passwords, salts, OTPs.
- **Purpose**: Highlight the role of secure randomness in cryptographic systems.

### Module 7: Hands-on Projects
- **Projects**: File Encryptor (AES), Secure Chat Simulation (RSA + AES), Digital Signature Verifier, Hash Comparator.
- **Purpose**: Apply cryptographic concepts in practical, real-world scenarios.

## 3. Why Use Core Java for Cryptography?
- **Built-in APIs**: `java.security` and `javax.crypto` provide robust, standardized implementations.
- **Portability**: Java’s platform independence ensures consistent behavior across systems.
- **Thread Safety**: Many cryptographic classes are thread-safe, suitable for concurrent applications.
- **No External Dependencies**: Core Java’s APIs eliminate the need for third-party libraries.
- **DSA Relevance**: Cryptographic algorithms use bitwise operations, modular arithmetic, and data structures (e.g., byte arrays), aligning with DSA learning.

## 4. Best Practices
- **Use Strong Algorithms**: Prefer AES and SHA-256 over outdated DES and MD5.
- **Handle Keys Securely**: Store keys in secure locations (e.g., `KeyStore`) and avoid hardcoding.
- **Use SecureRandom**: Always use `SecureRandom` for cryptographic operations.
- **Validate Inputs**: Check plaintext, ciphertext, and key lengths to prevent errors.
- **Catch Exceptions**: Handle `NoSuchAlgorithmException`, `InvalidKeyException`, etc., gracefully.
- **Avoid Legacy APIs**: Use modern `Cipher` methods over deprecated approaches.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify encryption/decryption, signing/verification, and edge cases.

## 5. Common Pitfalls
- **Using Weak Algorithms**: MD5 and DES are insecure; use SHA-256 and AES instead.
- **Improper Key Management**: Exposing private keys or using weak key sizes (e.g., 512-bit RSA).
- **Ignoring Padding**: Incorrect padding schemes (e.g., ECB) can lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Non-Secure Randomness**: Using `Random` instead of `SecureRandom` for keys or salts.
- **Concurrent Access**: Failing to account for thread safety in shared cryptographic objects.
